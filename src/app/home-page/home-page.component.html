              As a young and ambitious developer, I am looking for a new
              opportunity in which I can pursue my passion for IT and at the
              same time offers challenge and room for further education. In
              addition to good technical know-how, my strengths lie in web
              design and the graphic presentation of data. In my previous
              employment at PSI I turned research data into visually appealing
              and intuitive graphs and statistics. And at CAPCO I was
              responsible for the design and implementation of various UIX/GUIS.
              When I write applications, the user experience is always the top
              priority. It is very important to me that the user comes to the
              desired result through a natural and easy-to-navigate design.

            <h3>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</h3>

            <p>
              Having worked in two vastly different branches of IT , (that being
              science and FinTech ) Iâ€™ve learned to be flexible with
              expectations and efficient in my work- and communication methods.
              I have experience working in a small and detail-oriented team and
              have also worked on larger deadline-driven projects. In all cases,
              the companys Ive worked for had international clients which has
              gotten me quite experienced at english and technichal commication.
